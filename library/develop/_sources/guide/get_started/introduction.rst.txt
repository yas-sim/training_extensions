Introduction
============

**OpenVINO™ Training Extensions** is a low-code transfer learning framework for Computer Vision.

The framework's CLI commands and API allow users to easily train, infer, optimize and export models, even with limited deep learning expertise. OpenVINO™ Training Extensions offers diverse combinations of model architectures, learning methods, and task types based on `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ , `Lightning <https://lightning.ai/>`_ and `OpenVINO™ toolkit <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html>`_.

OpenVINO™ Training Extensions provide `recipe <https://github.com/open-edge-platform/training_extensions/tree/develop/lib/src/otx/recipe>`_ for every supported task type, which consolidates necessary information to build a model. Model configs are validated on various datasets and serve one-stop shop for obtaining the best models in general.

The development team is continuously expanding functionality to simplify the training process — aiming for a workflow where a single CLI command or a short API call is enough to produce accurate, efficient, and robust models ready for integration into your project.

Starting with OTX v2.4.5, we introduced a new repository structure and a more flexible backend concept. We're excited to present support for multiple backends — beginning with the OpenVINO™ backend, while all previous OTX functionality is now organized under the "native" backend.

In the future, we plan to integrate popular third-party libraries such as `Anomalib <https://github.com/open-edge-platform/anomalib>_`, `Transformers <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>_`, and more — seamlessly integrated into the repository.
This will enable users to train, test, export, and optimize a wide variety of models from different backends using the same CLI commands and unified API, without the need for reimplementation.

************
Key Features
************

OpenVINO™ Training Extensions supports the following computer vision tasks:

- **Classification**, including multi-class, multi-label and hierarchical image classification tasks.
- **Object detection** including rotated bounding box and tiling support
- **Semantic segmentation** including tiling algorithm support
- **Instance segmentation** including tiling algorithm support

OpenVINO™ Training Extensions provide the :doc:`following features <../explanation/additional_features/index>`:

- Native **Intel GPUs (XPU) support**. OpenVINO™ Training Extensions can be installed with XPU support to utilize Intel GPUs for training and testing.
- **Distributed training** to accelerate the training process when using multiple GPUs.
- **Half-precision (FP16) training** to reduce GPU memory usage and allow for larger batch sizes.
- **Class-incremental learning** to add new classes to an existing model without retraining from scratch.
- OpenVINO™ Training Extensions use `Datumaro <https://open-edge-platform.github.io/datumaro/stable/index.html>`_ as the backend for dataset handling. This allows support for many common academic dataset formats per task. More formats will be supported in the future, providing additional flexibility.
- **Multiple backend support** to easily adapt models from third-party implementations into the OpenVINO™ Training Extensions repository.
